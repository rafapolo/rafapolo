Hello there!

I have been creating algorithms since connecting to the Internet was an expensive ritual starting with mystic sounds for a mere 0.007MB/s. What a journey!

Before Git existed I was already working as a Software Developer for a Competitive Intelligence Startup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Enchanted by other biological machines as we are, I enjoy cultures, history and languages. Beyond Pascal, Python, Java or Ruby, I do Portuguese, Spanish, English, some German and Greek, as lived in Berlin, Athens, Lisbon and Zurich.

So, I've worked as an Engineer, DevOps, Tech Lead and Educator, supporting Journalists, Researchers, Designers, Biologists and CEOs.

I collect databases and am currently fascinated about LLMs and DataViz > See [ミ.xyz/dataviz](https://xn--2dk.xyz/dataviz)
