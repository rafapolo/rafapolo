<p>I have been building software projects since connecting to the Internet was an expensive ritual starting with mystic sounds for a mere 0.007MB/s. What a journey it has been since the 90's!</p>


<p>Before Git existed, I've worked as a Software Developer for a Competitive Intelligence startup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

<p>Fascinated by “biological machines” as ourselves, I enjoy learning cultures, history, and languages. Alongside programming in Ruby, Python, Javascript and some Crystal, I speak Portuguese, Spanish, English, some German and Greek - as I've lived in Berlin, Athens, Lisbon, and Zurich over the last 15 years.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked as an Engineer, DevOps, Tech Lead, and Educator, supporting journalists, researchers, designers, and CEOs.</p>

<p>I collect public databases and am currently immersed inn LLMs and data visualization</p>
