Hello there!

I have been building software projects since connecting to the Internet was an expensive ritual starting with mystic sounds for a mere 0.007MB/s. What a journey it has been since the 90's!

Before Git existed, I've worked as a Software Developer for a Competitive Intelligence startup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Fascinated by “biological machines” like ourselves, I enjoy learning cultures, history, and languages. Alongside programming in Pascal, Python, Javascript, and Ruby, I speak Portuguese, Spanish, English, some German, and Greek - as lived in Berlin, Athens, Lisbon, and Zurich over the last 15 years.

Over the years, I’ve worked as an Engineer, DevOps, Tech Lead, and Educator, supporting journalists, researchers, designers, and CEOs.

I collect public databases and am currently fascinated by LLMs and data visualization → See https://ミ.xyz/dataviz
