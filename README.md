Hello there!

I have been building software projects since connecting to the Internet was an expensive ritual starting with mystic sounds for a mere 0.007MB/s. What a journey it has been since 1985!

Even before Git existed, I worked as a Software Developer at a Competitive Intelligence startup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Fascinated by “biological machines” like ourselves, I enjoy exploring cultures, history, and languages. Alongside programming in Pascal, Python, Java, and Ruby, I speak Portuguese, Spanish, English, some German, and Greek - as lived in Berlin, Athens, Lisbon, and Zurich.

Over the years, I’ve worked as an Engineer, DevOps, Tech Lead, and Educator, supporting journalists, researchers, designers, and CEOs.

I collect databases and am currently fascinated by LLMs and data visualization → See ミ.xyz/dataviz
